# Linear Regression Project

This project demonstrates linear regression using Python, Streamlit, and machine learning libraries. It includes a web app for interactive data analysis and model prediction.

## Project Structure

- `streamlit_app.py`: Streamlit web application for data visualization and model prediction.
- `model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- `keras_model.h5`: Saved Keras model file.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `dataset/NFLX.csv`: Sample dataset (Netflix stock data).

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install dependencies:
	```
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
	```
	streamlit run streamlit_app.py
	```

## Usage

- Use the Jupyter notebook (`model.ipynb`) for data analysis and model training.
- Launch the Streamlit app to interactively visualize data and make predictions.

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for all required Python packages.
