# stocks-trend-prediction

This project demonstrates stocks analysis using Python, Streamlit, LSTM. It includes a web app for interactive data analysis and model prediction.
This model is trained on NFLX dataset, you can use different datasets for test. Here another dataset is provided in this repository for testing or you can use current datasets.

## Project Structure

- `streamlit_app.py`: Streamlit web application for data visualization and model prediction.
- `model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- `keras_model.h5`: Saved Keras model file.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `dataset/NFLX.csv`: Sample dataset (Netflix stock data).

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install dependencies:
	```
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
	```
	streamlit run streamlit_app.py
	```

## Usage

- Use the Jupyter notebook (`model.ipynb`) for data analysis and model training.
- Launch the Streamlit app to interactively visualize data and make predictions.

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for all required Python packages.
